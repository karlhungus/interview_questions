Just some that I've come across, solutions aren't optimal, or even great. I wanted a way to remember the
classifications of problems I've solved, and at least by memory how I'd solved them.

## Technical Meeting Types

So far I've run into these types (or combinations):

1. Live coding interview - Typically easy problems, most of the problems in this repo are from these interviews
2. Whiteboard - These can range from implment a sort, to design a system
3. Exercise you submit - Assumes normal tools availablity (google/stackoverflow)
5. Nothing at all - Only ever when someone knows you
6. Pairing - pair with a coder who works for the company
7. Code Review - Given a pr, review the code, find issues

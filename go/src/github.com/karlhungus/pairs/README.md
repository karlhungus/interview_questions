## Gift Exchange

I have a CSV file of friends who want to be paired up in order to exchange gifts.

1. Write a script that processes the CSV file below and loads it into some sort of data structure you can work with.
2. Randomly assign every person to another.
3. Print each person's email followed by the email of the person they're paired with (see expected output below).

Notes:

- Do not pair anyone with themselves.
- Every person should be paired up with another person -- don't leave anybody out ğŸ˜­ .
- It should be random - if we run the script multiple times we should get different results.

Expected output:
```
turner_it_around@hotmail.com -> spatel76@gmail.com
spatel76@gmail.com -> ahmed@live.ca
ahmed@live.ca -> turner_it_around@hotmail.com
```
